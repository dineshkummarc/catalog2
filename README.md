# phpmyCatalog

phpmyCatalog (i.e. Catalog2) is a flat-file (DBless) PHP application to manage your home library. If you don't care about who hosts your stuff, choose LibraryThing. If you want complex, almost library-like stuff, go for OpenBiblio, Koha or Evergreen. But if you want to own your book data and you would keep it simple without all the functionalities too much for an average user, Catalog2 is for you.

Catalog2 is a viable solution for managing small and mid-size home libraries.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0+

## Installation, backup and forgotten password

### Installation

1. Download and unpack the `.zip` or clone this repository.
2. Rename the top level folder to your liking (eg. `catalog2`).
3. Upload the folder to the desired location on your web server.
	- Make sure that your `data/ebooks` folder's permissions are set to `755`.
4. Visit the folder in your browser (eg. `http://example.com/catalog2`).
5. Provide a username, a password and your Google Books API Key (latter is optional).
6. Click the button and you're done. Have fun.

### Backups

To back up your data, make sure that you regularly make a copy of the following files and folders:

- `application/config/config.yml`
- `data/*`

`config.yml` stores your credentials and Google Books API Key, while the `data` folder stores all the data of your collection.

### Forgotten password

Since your password is stored as a salted-hashed string, there is no way to recover it.

If you forgot your password, refer to the below process. Your data remains intact, however it is always a good idea to back up your `data` folder before taking actions like this.

1. Visit your Catalog2 folder on your web server via FTP.
2. Remove the file `application/config/config.yml`;
	- your Google  Books API Key will also be lost.
3. Visit your Catalog2 instance via browser.
4. You will be redirected to `register.php`.
5. Re-register yourself.
6. You will be redirected to the Login screen, where you can log in with your new credentials.
