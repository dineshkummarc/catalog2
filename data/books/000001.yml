  *Lest any one may charge me with extravagant optimism* in regard to convicts, or may think that to me every goose is a swan, I wish to say that I have written only of the men-among hundreds of convicts-who have **most interested me**; men whom I have known thoroughly and who never attempted to deceive me. Every writer's `vision` of life and of humanity is inevitably colored by his own personality, and I have pictured these men as I saw them; but I have also endeavored, in using so much from their letters, to leave the reader free to form his own opinion. ~~Doubtless the key~~ to my own position is the fact that I always studied these prisoners as men; and I tried not to obscure my vision by looking at them through their crimes. In recalling conversations I have not depended upon memory alone, as much of what was said in our interviews was written out while still fresh in my mind.
